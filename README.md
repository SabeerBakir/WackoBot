# WackoBot

This project is my exploration into creating my first Discord Bot.

~~I will following along closly with [The Coding Train's youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A-bnPlxj4k&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6avBYxeBSwF48YhAnSn_sA4) on how to make a Discord Bot with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/).~~

Since the above Coding train video, both the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) has been updated.

I instead opted to follow the [introduction guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin) on from discord.js.
